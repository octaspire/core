This is amalgamated single file source release for Octaspire Core library.
File 'octaspire-core-amalgamated.c' is all that is needed; it has no other
dependencies than a C compiler and standard library supporting subset of C99.

Building instructions for all supported platforms (and scripts for building
automatically) can be found in directory 'how-to-build'. Look for a file that
has your platform's name in the file's name. If instructions for your
platform are not yet added, looking instructions for a similar system will
probably help. The amalgamation contains only one source file and should be
straightforward to use. By using few compiler defines, the single file can
be used for different purposes:

    (1) to build stand-alone unit test runner for the file.
    (2) to use the file as a single file header+library in C/C++ programs
        wanting to use the Octaspire Core library.

Octaspire Core is work in progress. The most recent version
of this amalgamated source release can be downloaded from:

    * octaspire.com
    * https://octaspire.io

Directory 'documentation' contains a manual and directory 'examples' has
some short examples.
